Things to do at the start of the course
=======================

There are several things you'll need to do at the start of the course to get set up with all the technology, accounts, and services we'll be using.
I've split these tasks up into several chunks so it's a bit more manageable. 

## At the end of the first week

```{dropdown} 8. Complete the first Learning Log (LL01) on Gradescope.
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold
    :open:

This assignment will help you get familiar with answering questions on Gradescope, some of its features, and how you can access feedback on your learning logs.
```

```{dropdown} 9. Complete your first Test (Test 0) PrairieLearn (not for marks)
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold
    :open:

This timed test will help you get familiar with answering questions on the PrairieLearn platform.
We will be using this platform for the Tests in this course.
