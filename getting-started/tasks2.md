Things to do at the start of the course
=======================

There are several things you'll need to do at the start of the course to get set up with all the technology, accounts, and services we'll be using.
I've split these tasks up into several chunks so it's a bit more manageable. 

## In the first week of the course

```{dropdown} 6. Read the Syllabus and the Unsyllabus

    :open:
The syllabus and unsullabus is now live on Canvas under the "Course Content" sidebar item. You can also {{ '[view it outside of Canvas here]({link})'.format(link=COURSE_LINK) }}.

I want to know what you think of the course unsyllabus! 
Yes, I want your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on how you want the course to go this term. 
If one of you has a good idea for a change, adjustment or addition - I'd love to adopt it if it fits with the course.
I strongly believe that you are now in charge of your own education, and I am just a guide to help point you in the right direction. 

The Unsyllabus also has lots of details about how this class will be run, my teaching philosophy, dates, deadlines, and other course policies.
I encourage you to read it!

By now, if you filled out the [course introduction survey](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4UYDc6zEiwa2Jq6) you should have been invited to join the course discussion forum, called Ed Discussion.

Join and say hi!
