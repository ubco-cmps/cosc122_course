# Task 4 - Moving YOUR Character using transform()

Previously (in Task 2), you moved your character by adding mouseX and mouseY to every (x,y) of all shapes in your character. 
Today, we will move the character using a simpler technique.

## Specifications

1) duplicate your character code from Task 1 and call it `task4.pde`
2) add one statement at the beginning to move (`translate()`) your character.
