# Task 3 - Creating a Simple Image

As discussed in task 2, you will be using GIMP to create an original image.
You will be using some of the different tools introduced in task 2, however you are more than welcome to explore around and try new things.

**Try to come up with something that you would want to add to the personal web page you will be making in Lab 4.**

## Task 3.1 Create a new file

In GIMP's main window, click "File", then select "New...". A dialog box will appear. Click ""OK"" to accept the default image size, although you can change this if you wish.

## Task 3.2 Create an original image

You will note that this task focuses entirely on developing an entirely new picture using the available tools.

**Note that the image does not need to be super complex as that would take a lot of time and is beyond the scope of this course. We are not looking for artistic masterpieces, but you're more than welcome to express your creative self.**

We will provide some general guidelines for the task, however we expect you to create an image of your own for this task.

1. Add a background.

2. Draw at least four different shapes.

3. Use the pencil and paintbrush with two different colours. 

4. Change the opacity of two elements. 

5. Add at least one special effect to your image.

## Task 3.3 Save finished image into the repository

Once you have finished creating your original image, you will need to save it into your repository.
Click on "File", then select "Export As...", then save the image as `image_task3.png`.

1. In the VS Code web-editor, click "File", then "New Text File", and then save the file as `activity_task3.md`.

2. Add the local image into the file like this: 

```
![sample - YOUR NAME](images/image_task3.png)
```

**To access the image from the Markdown file in your repository, then make sure to drag and drop the png file to the sidebar of your repository.**

## Specifications

Remember that we are using a "Specifications Grading" system for the labs in this course. [More details are available in the Unsyllabus](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/cosc122/2022_WT1/about/unsyllabus.html#specifications-grading).

For this task, the specifications are:

- Create a GIMP file and a Markdown file titled `activity_task3.md`

- Complete all the elements outlined correctly.

- Add your original image to the repository and the Markdown file.

Remember that though each task has separate specifications, you will only get one combined grade for each lab (E,G,R, or I). You will get feedback for each of the tasks separately.
