# Lab 3 - Drawing Graphics and Manipulating Images

In this lab, you will be working with a tool called "GIMP", which stands for GNU Image Manipulation to draw graphics and manipulate images.
There are four tasks in this lab, the first task is to get setup with the desktop VS Code app, and the second task is a reading exercise to get you familiar with GIMP.
In Task 3, you will draw your own graphic, and in Task 4 you will be working with an image.
