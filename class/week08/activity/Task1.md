# Task 1 - Move Your Player

In the last lecture activity, you created a game platform and in this task you will move your player.
In this Task, you should re-use your PDE file for this task(copy it and rename it `task1.pde`). 
Remember, you can copy a file using the Terminal:

```
cp path\to\file1.pde path\to\copiedfile1.pde
```

## Specifications

- Include a file called `task1.pde` somewhere in your repository that starts with the game platform from the previous activity. If you have not completed that yet, take the time now to do so.
- Update your code so that the player moves left or right with the arrow keys.
- The player should be moving as long as an arrow key is pressed and should stop moving if the key is released.
