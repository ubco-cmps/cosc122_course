## Labs

We are using GitHub Classroom to deliver the labs for this course.
You will first need to create a GitHub account, and then you can accept each lab.
Once the lab is ready, the link will become active, and you will be able to accept the lab into your GitHub.com account.
This is the most efficient way to deliver instructions (and code!) to you.

Once you click the link, a repository will automatically be created for you with some starter code.
You can then work on the lab, make commits, and push them to GitHub as often as you please. 
Once the deadline and the grace period has passed, you will no longer be able to push any changes.

```{tip}
Remember that once you've accepted the GitHub Classroom link, the link to your repository becomes fixed so once you submit it, you can continue to make changes as many times as you like before the deadline (and even after it), but we may only check the submission made closest to the deadline.
