## Class Activities

We are using GitHub Classroom to deliver the Class Activities for this course.
You will first need to create a GitHub account, and then you can accept each Class Activity.
Once the Lecture Activities is ready (usually activities are available during the class), the link will become active, and you will be able to accept the lab in your GitHub.com account.

Once you click the link, a repository will automatically be created for you with some starter code.
You can then work on the Lecture Activities, make commits, and push them to GitHub as often as you please. 
Once the deadline and the grace period has passed, you will no longer be able to push any changes.

```{tip}
Remember that once you've accepted the GitHub Classroom link, the link to your repository becomes fixed so you can submit it on Gradescope as many times as you like before the deadline. Each time you submit on Gradescope it will submit your **latest** commit. This is what we will mark, if you make changes to your repository after submitting it on Gradescope, we will not see it unless you re-submit on Gradescope.
