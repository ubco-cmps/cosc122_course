# Lab 1

Lab 1 of this course has three tasks.
The first task is [installing the tech stack](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/2021_WT2/cosc123/notes/setup/stack.html), the second task is practicing Markdown syntax, and the third task is to install Processing on your computer.

## First-time Submission Instructions

Once you are done with this assignment, **you will need to submit your repository for grading on Gradescope**.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.**

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:
