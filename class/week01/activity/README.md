## First-time Submission Instructions

Once you are done with this assignment, **you will need to submit your repository for grading on PrairieLearn**.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on PrairieLearn to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on PrairieLearn as many times as you like.**

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on PrairieLearn:
