## First-time Submission Instructions

Once you are done with this assignment, **you will need to submit your repository for grading on Gradescope**.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.**

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:

Those same instructions are summarized here in text:

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment for this lab - see "Course Content" on Canvas (if you are reading this, you may have already done this).

1. Clone the assignment to your computer using (remember to use your own unique clone link):

```
git clone https://github.com/demoFiras/activity1.git
```

1. Make changes to your assignment and frequently add and commit your changes:

```
git add .
git commit -m "halfway through Task 1"
```

1. Push your change to GitHub so they are pushed to the cloud (important if your computer is destroyed in a giant ball of fire).

```
git push
```

1. Log in to your Canvas course, and click Gradescope in the left sidebar.

1. You will be enrolled in the course and receive a confirmation email. Gradescope will also open in a new window/tab with your course dashboard and all active assignments.

1. If this is your first time using Gradescope, you will need to set a password:

In the confirmation email you received from Gradescope, click the set your password link.
Enter the same password in the password and password confirmation fields, and click Set Password.

1. You can now access Gradescope through your Canvas course.

1. When in Gradescope, click the course and you will see a list of assignments. Select the assignment you want to submit.

1. The first time you do this, you may need to sync your GitHub account with Gradescope, and GRANT permission to our GitHub organization.

1. Once you log in and link your GitHub account, you should find the repository and submit it to Gradescope.

1. Gradescope will email you a confirmation of your submitted work, with a link to the submission.

Note: If you make any future commits to this repository, you will need to re-submit on Gradescope.

You are all done with this assignment!

Congratulations!
