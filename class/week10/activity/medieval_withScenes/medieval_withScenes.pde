  1-Run the code (Ctrl+R) and observe the output.
  2-Familiarize yourself with how the code is divided into tabs.
  3-Implement the following two requirements 
      REQ1: go to scene1 tab and implement the REQs in the comments there
      REQ2: add one more scene as described in the lecture notes.
