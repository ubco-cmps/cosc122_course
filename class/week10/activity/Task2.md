# Task 2 - Draw Your Character with Functions

For this task you should reuse your code from previous lecture activities. Remember, you can copy a file using the Terminal:

```
cp path\to\file1.pde path\to\copiedfile1.pde
```

Update your code so that the character is drawn in a function. The parameters should be the position, the scale, and the body and belt colors. Use this function to draw 2 or 3 of your character. 

Use this header: *drawSuperhero(int x,int y, float scale, color c1, color c2);*

*Hint:* whenever you transform the coordinates inside a function, it is better to restore the original coordinates before leaving the function. HOW can you do this?
