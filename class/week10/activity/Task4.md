# Task 4 - Be Creative...

* Expand the code from the Space Inavders game (Week 10 slides 45-49) to include any one of the following items:
  - Improve game items (spaceships and bullet)
      - e.g. replace with images, use better vector designs (e.g. enemy should be more than just a moving dull circle), etc.
  - Change the code so that the enemy follows one of three predefined paths every time it enters the window from the top. The chosen path should be selected randomly.
      - Define 3 paths: sinusoidal, noise(), and diagonal. Each time the enemy enters the screen, it randomly selects one of the 3 paths and follows it until either it exits the screen (from the bottom) or it is shot.
  - Allow your spaceship to shoot another bullet (total of 2 bullets).
      - You cannot use arrays or OOP.
