# Task 2 - Update your game

1. Start with your game from Lecture Activity 10

2. Copy the code to Lecture Activity 11 (cp)

3. If you havenâ€™t already, organize your code so it uses tabs

4. Use object-oriented programming to create two classes:
  - Ground Enemies (or Goombas from the original Mario)
  - Flying Enemies (or Paratroopa from the original Mario)

5. Add 3 ground enemies and 5 flying enemies; they should all have different names, and be of different colours; flying enemies should be restricted to the air, and ground enemies cannot fly.

6. Remember that the original names and images are probably copyrighted, so you will have to find your own!
