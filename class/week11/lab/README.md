## General Submission Instructions

Once you are done with this assignment, **you will need to submit your repository for grading on Gradescope**.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.**

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:

Those same instructions are summarized here in text:

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment for this lab - see "Course Content" on Canvas (if you are reading this, you may have already done this).

1. Clone the assignment to your computer using (remember to use your own unique clone link):

```
git clone https://github.com/demoFiras/lab1.git
```

1. Make changes to your assignment and frequently add and commit your changes:

```
git add .
git commit -m "halfway through Task 1"
```

1. Push your change to GitHub so they are pushed to the cloud (important if your computer is destroyed in a giant ball of fire).

```
git push
```

1. Log in to your Canvas course, and click Gradescope in the left sidebar.

1. In Gradescope, select the assignment you want to submit to.

1. You should find the repository and submit it to Gradescope.

1. Gradescope will email you a confirmation of your submitted work, with a link to the submission.

Note: If you make any future commits to this repository, you will need to re-submit on Gradescope.

You are all done with this assignment!

Congratulations!
