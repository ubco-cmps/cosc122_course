Week 13 Summary
=======================

## About this page

Each week, on the "Week X Summary" page, you will find a list of things you have to do this week, and the suggested order. 
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
Once you finish the task, check off the box so you can keep track of your progress (just a note, I will not know whether you click the checkboxes or not).
