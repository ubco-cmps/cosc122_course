## Final exam rules

The usual "Test" rules apply to the final exam also:

- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc...)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web, open-IDE (include PDE) EXCEPT websites that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow is permissible).
- Copying the question text and googling IS CHEATING
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you IS CHEATING
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating.
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Generally, we will not be able to answer questions during the Final Exam (though you are welcome to ask if you suspect a typo or a problem) - do your best with your best interpretation.
- Do NOT share Exam questions with anyone - that IS CHEATING.
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine :-)

## Academic Integrity

You will be expected to uphold the highest standard of academic integrity during your final exam for COSC 123, and all other courses as well.
As a reminder, here is UBCO's statement on Academic Integrity:

> The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
> As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
> At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
> This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
> Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
> For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
> Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.
