# COSC 123 Final Exam

I suggest you read the instructions on this page carefully, as I don't want you to lose marks for silly reasons. Additionally, I am giving you the questions in Part 3 in advance so you can prepare some notes for yourself.

## Logistics

- The final exam will be conducted in 3 parts; you can do them in any order you like:
    - Part 1 (10 marks) will be multiple choice questions on PrairieLearn.
    - Part 2 (70 marks) will require you to clone a GitHub repo locally, and complete some coding tasks.
    - Part 3 (20 marks) will be some reflection questions that you will be given in advance.
- The final exam will be scheduled exam during the official scheduled time
- The final exam will have a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes, you will be given 5 additional minutes after the exam to upload your GitHub repo on GitHub.
- Before the final exam starts, you will be expected to join our Zoom session **AND STAY IN THE ZOOM SESSION FOR THE DURATION OF YOUR EXAM** ; after I do the introduction, you will be randomly split off into breakout rooms, where you will have an invigilator.
- The final exam will have the same rules as the Tests (without the test window), see below.
- You do not need to have your cameras or microphones turned on during the invigilation session.

## Final exam rules

The usual "Test" rules apply to the final exam also:

- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc...)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web, open-IDE (include PDE) EXCEPT websites that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow is permissible).
- Copying the question text and googling IS CHEATING
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you IS CHEATING
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating.
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Generally, we will not be able to answer questions during the Final Exam (though you are welcome to ask if you suspect a typo or a problem) - do your best with your best interpretation.
- Do NOT share Exam questions with anyone - that IS CHEATING.
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine :-)

## Academic Integrity

You will be expected to uphold the highest standard of academic integrity during your final exam for COSC 123, and all other courses as well.
As a reminder, here is UBCO's statement on Academic Integrity:

> The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
> As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
> At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
> This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
> Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
> For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the Presidentâ€™s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
> Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

## Final Exam Instructions

Below are the full final exam instructions. I am sharing these with you so you can get a sense of what your final exam will look like.

## Part 1. Multiple choice questions on PrairieLearn (10 marks)

The first part of the COSC 123 exam is multiple-choice (similar to the questions on your Tests) and should be completed on PrairieLearn.
There will be no questions on this part requiring you to write any code.

## Part 2. Coding Portion using GitHub and submitting on Gradescope (70 Marks)

The second part of the exam requires you to clone a GitHub repo to your computer and complete some coding tasks.
You will be given a link to accept your Final Exam.
The questions are written in a way such that you can do them in any order you like, and if you cannot get one question, you can still complete the other questions.

7 of the 70 marks in this section will be awarded if you correctly add, commit, and push changes in your local repo to GitHub.
You will see these instructions after every question:

```
### Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you finish attempting this question, you should add a commit with a useful commit message indicating the status of this question (completed, attempted, partially done, etc...this question).

Push your commit to GitHub using your **Terminal** (i.e. do not use the drag and drop on the web).

**Note: you are more than welcome to come back to this question later and make more commits.**
All I ask is that you have at least one commit per question.
```

**WARNING: PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE README FILES, AND AVOID CHANGING THE PROVIDED CODE, OR ADDING ADDITIONAL FILES (IF YOU DO, THOSE FILES WILL NOT BE GRADED)!**

**ONLY THE FOLLOWING FILES WILL BE GRADED:**

- Q1.pde
- Q2.pde
- Q3.pde
- Q4.pde
- Q5.pde
- **ALL** the files in the Q6.pde directory

Any other files will be ignored on Gradescope, and will not be graded WITH NO EXCEPTIONS.

**THE QUESTION INSTRUCTIONS BELOW ARE REPEATED IN THE FOLDER FOR EACH QUESTION.**

... details of the Coding Tasks ...

## Part 3. Course Reflection on Gradescope (20 marks)

The last part of the final exam requires you to answer some reflection questions on Gradescope.
These questions were shared with you a few days before the final exam.
You are encouraged to bring prepared answers to these questions.

Here are the questions on the course reflection:

### Q7 Final Course and Exam Reflection

This question should only be done after you have completed all the Tasks in the Final Exam, it needs to be submitted separately in this Gradescope assignment.

#### 7.1.1 Final Exam Deserved Grade (1)

Just as we have done each week in the course, I would like you to estimate your **deserved grade on the final exam that you just completed** (please make sure you answer this question only after completing all the tasks on the Final Exam.

Please provide a number between 0 and 100% corresponding to your deserved grade on the **final exam** for this course:

[____]

#### 7.1.2 Course Deserved Grade (2)

**What grade do you deserve in this course and why?**

As an educator, I am very aware that learning is not easily measured by scores on tests, and exams. There are many other ways and sources of learning, and I admit that not everything can be captured by the assessments that I give you.

Pretend that there were no guidelines in the syllabus for calculating your final grade. Based on the work that you have done all semester, and the learning goals for the course, what grade (out of 100) do you think you have earned?

From the syllabus, here are the course goals:

> You should take this course to see how art and coding can come together to produce wondrous creations. Our ultimate goal is to give you a more fun introduction to programming by allowing you to express your creativity. You will learn programming basics such as decisions, iteration, objects, methods, and classes through the Processing language. You will also explore events, graphics, animation, 2D gaming, and file manipulation while practicing programming concepts. By completing this course, I hope you will understand programming fundamentals, have created interesting and fun programs and animations, and have the ability to continue in following computer science courses.

Note that you will not be graded based on how accurate your deserved grade is to your actual grade, but the quality of your reflection.

Try **NOT** to focus on calculating your earned grade and avoid mentioning or referring to average grades on the labs, tests, lecture activities, or even the posted grade with your grade before the final exam.

What is some other evidence of your learning? Consider not just what you have learned, but how much effort you put into the course (and whether that effort was productive or not), and honestly assess how much of the material you feel truly comfortable with.

Your answer should be in two parts:

A number between 0 and 100 corresponding to your earned grade in this course.

[____]

Approximately 3-5 sentences with an explanation/justification of your earned grade.

|____|

#### 7.2 Cool or Inspiring Concept (6 marks)

Carefully consider **one computer science concept** from this course that you found "cool" or "inspiring"; 

Explain the concept, and why you found it cool or inspiring.

Your answer should be approximately 6-8 sentences in total and have the following requirements:


- **List the concept you have selected to be cool or inspiring** (1 sentence).

[____]()

- **Explain why you think the concept is cool or inspiring** (2-3 sentences).

|____|

- **Explain the concept** in a way that would be understood by a future Data 301 student that has never taken a computer science class before. (3-4 sentences)

|____|

#### 7.3 Arts, Society, Culture and Processing (6 marks)

Give at **least three examples** of how things you learned in this course could benefit our world from the lens of the Arts, Society, Culture. Consider how your imagination been enhanced as a result of taking this class.

**You should have a minimum of 5-7 sentences in total to get full marks on this question and you should give at least three examples.**

To help you, I have added three boxes so you can identify three different and independent thoughts/examples.

Example 1:

|____|

Example 2:

|____|

Example 3:

|____|

#### 7.4 Untested Content

In final exams, it is often not possible to test every single concept or idea discussed in the term.

Choose a concept or an idea that you studied for that was part of the course, but wasn't tested on this final exam. 

Clearly state the concept or idea:

[____]

and then demonstrate your understanding of the concept by explaining it in words or code at the level of a peer in the class.

You should have a minimum of 3-5 sentences to get full marks on this question.
