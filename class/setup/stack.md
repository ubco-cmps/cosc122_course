COSC 123 Technology Stack
=======================

As you go through this install guides, remember that perhaps the two most important things you will learn in this course is how to troubleshoot things and achieve familiarity and proficiency with your computer.
Be patient, read things carefully, do not be afraid to try things, it's unlikely you will do anything to irreversibly break your computer! 
Almost everything you do (you're on your own if you decide to take a hammer to your laptop!) can be undone, don't be afraid to ask your peers, TAs, and the instructor on {{ FORUM_LINK }}.

This is an exciting time for you as you begin your journey!
