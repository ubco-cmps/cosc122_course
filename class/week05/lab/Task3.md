*Follow these steps*
- Create a still design first. Note that you will need to transform the coordinates to properly produce the required design.
- Identify the attributes that need to be animated. In this example, you will need to animate (1) the coordinates scale and angle, and (2) the transparency of all items.
- Create a variable for each attribute you want to animate. In this example, you will have exactly three variables for scale, angle, and transparency.
- Replace that attributesâ€™ values with the variables.
- Slightly modify that variables at the end of each frame.

## Specifications

- We are expecting you to commit your work often (try to aim for a minimum of 3-5 commits per lab) with useful commit messages marking your progress.
- Design is correct.
- Transformation is correct. 
- Three attributes are animated: scale, angle, and transparency.
