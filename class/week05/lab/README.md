# Lab 4 - Building your own web page

**Warning: This will probably be your longest lab of the term so far with the most amount of "self-study". You will probably need to attend the lab sessions, and ask for lots of help on Ed Discussion to complete this lab. We will also give you a little bit of extra time to work on this lab. Do not leave it to the last minute!**

In this lab, you will be using HTML to build our own web page.
In Task 1, you will learn the basics of CSS (cascading style sheets), and get introduced to Bootstrap, an HTML framework to help you quickly build fast and responsive websites.
In Task 2, you will practice using basic components like Buttons, Badges, Images, and deploy your websites so it can be viewed publicly.
In Task 3, you will practice using the grid system in Bootstrap, and add Cards.
In Task 4, you will practice using Navigation and Navigation Bar components.
In Task 5, you will put it all together and make a fully functioning Bootstrap website!
