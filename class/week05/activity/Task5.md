# Task 5 - Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it is...!

Make your character fly from the bottom right corner of the screen to the top left corner as the animation advances. At the same time, make the limbs shake to give the illusion of fast flying.

## Specifications

- use two variables x,y to control the location of the character. Decrement both every frame.
- Add some randomness to the position of lines representing the limbs.
- Rotate the scene using coordinate transformation.
