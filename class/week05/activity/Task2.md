## Task 2 - Analogue Clock Part 1
Write code to animate the seconds hand in a clock

The Idea: 
  - Transform your origin to the center of the sketch (use width & height)
  - Draw the clock face and numbers.
  - Draw the ‘seconds’ hand as line from (0,0) to (x,y) where x and y are calculated using the circle equation: *x = r*cos(theta)* and *y = r*sin(theta)*
    * `r` is the length of the seconds hand.
    * theta is the angle and should be incremented every second by exactly 6 degrees.
    * To increment theta every second, set the frame rate to 1 frame per second and increment by one every frame
