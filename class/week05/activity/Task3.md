## Task 3 - Analogue Clock Part 2

Improve your analogue clock.

## Specifications

Repeat the previous task and make the following changes:

* Have a variable called seconds that is initialized to 0.
* For every new frame:
  - Increment seconds by 1.
  - Donâ€™t increment the angle. Instead, compute it based on seconds. Use the following formula:
      *theta = (seconds * (PI/30)) - (PI/2)*
  - Then use theta as before to draw the seconds hand.
