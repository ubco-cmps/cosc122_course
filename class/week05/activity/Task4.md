## Task 4 - Analogue Clock Part 3

Repeat the previous exercise after changing the frame rate to 60 while maintaining the same update rate for the hands second.

## Specifications

- Replace the variable seconds you used before with the second() function, i.e. 
    *theta = (**second()** * (PI/30)) - (PI/2)*

- This program should be almost identical to the previous version except for a few (probably 2) statements.
