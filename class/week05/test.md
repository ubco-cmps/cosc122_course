Note that I have shifted the percentages a bit.
The test will cover everything we've covered in Week 1 and 2, including:

- Internet and Communications
- HTML Syntax
- Week 3 and 4 content

Remember that Test 1 will be available starting during class on Friday, and you need to be present in class to take the test, unless prior arrangements have been made with me.
You will have 45 minutes to complete the test.

## Test Rules 

Here are the test rules, read them carefully!

- You will have 75 minutes to complete the test (unless you have an accommodation from the DRC).
- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc…)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web, open-IDE (include PDE) EXCEPT websites that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow is permissible).
- Copying the question text and googling IS CHEATING Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you IS CHEATING
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating.
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do not be anxious about the test! If you don’t do well - review the material and try again next week - we will take the better of the two marks!
- You will not be able to ask us questions during the quiz - do your best with your best interpretation.
- For coding questions, please type your code directly in the editor that is provided to you (do not upload your file instead).
- Do NOT share test questions with anyone until the Test is complete - that IS CHEATING.
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine :-)
