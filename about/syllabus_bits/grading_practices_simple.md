```{note}
Note: Until at least January 24th, all labs will be offered online via Zoom. Attendance in the lab sessions is **not** required, but you cannot pass the course without completing the labs. You are able to attend any of the labs sessions in the course (i.e. not just the ones you are registered in), as many times as you like to get extra help.

Since our class is quite large, lectures will be online on Zoom the whole term, and will be recorded.
