I hope by taking this course you will gain new confidence in your computer and technology skills!

Have you ever wanted to be more tech-savvy and feel more confident in your computer skills?
Do you feel somewhat left out with how fast technology is being adopted in our society?
Do you wish you could just get a summary of the most important things for you to be productive in society?
Well, if the answer to any of those questions is yes, then this course is for you!
The most important thing you will learn is more about your computer and how to make the best use of it.
You will also learn how the internet works, how to create a website, how to edit and create documents and presentations, as well as essential programming skills.
The specific tools we will use do not matter that much, because the concepts you learn can be applied to future tools and technologies as well.
The ultimate goal of this course is to set you up for lifelong success and give you practice with some essential tools so you can develop an understanding of technology in society and be productive.

```{warning} 
You will notice that this course has no pre-requisites and so is intended for students who are interested in becoming more "fluent" with computers, but currently do not have those skills and expertise. Of course, you are more than welcome to take this course even if you already have these skills, but keep in mind that you may be bored, and other courses may be a better use of your time and money!
