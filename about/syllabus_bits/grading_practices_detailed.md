The grading scheme for this course is:

| Item             | Weight          | Due date(s)                  |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Learning Logs    | 10% (10 x 1%)   | Saturdays at 6 PM            |
| Class Activities | 15% (10 x 1.5%) | Thursdays at 6 PM            |
| Labs             | 30% (10 x 3%)   | Fridays at 6 PM              |
| Tests            | 25% (5 x 5%)    | Thursday 6 PM - Saturday 6PM |
| Final Exam (TBD) | 20%             | TBD                          |

There will be 5 tests in this course in an (approximately) bi-weekly schedule.
For each of the tests, there will be a bonus test one week later and the better score of the Test-Bonus Test pair will be taken.

```{note}
Important: The maximum mark you can get on each item is 100%. Any available bonus marks are not transferable to other assignments.
```

### Other Grading Policies

There is a delicate balance between an instructor being flexible with deadlines, and giving students (particularly in introductory courses) too much freedom, to the detriment of your learning and your work habits.

#### No late penalties for late submissions of Class Activities and Labs

It is important to build a rhythm as you go through undergraduate courses (particularly mine) and to do that, there is a fixed schedule that must be followed. 
Of course, deviation from the ideal schedule happens frequently in a term when students are taking other courses as well. 
That's why I have built in some "pressure releases" in this course so you have another way to manage the workload of the term.
Over the years, I have tried to strike a good balance in this course with my policies but I'd like to experiment with a few tweaks this year.

```{attention} 
**For only the Labs and Class Activities**, deadlines are only suggestions to ensure you stay on track with the material. In general, there will be no late marks taken off for late submissions and regardless of the level you earn, you have unlimited opportunities to resubmit your work (see below for details).
```

That being said, I suggest not relying on this too much because it will set you back and if you fall too far behind, there's a danger of running out of time to catch up.

```{note}
Note: Assignments cannot be accepted beyond the last day of classes. This is non-negotiable!
```

#### Specifications-Grading

Many of you are familiar with the "Traditional Grading" model many courses use.
Briefly, this model involves earning (or losing) points on individual assessments throughout the course, and then a grade calculated by doing a "weighted-average" throughout the term.

You may be surprised to learn that this is not the only way classes can be structured, and there are alternative models that research has shown to be far better for learning, motivation, attitudes, and long-term benefit.
If you're interested in learning more details about the last sentence (and if it surprises you), I encourage you to [check out this very accessible paper](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.cbe-14-03-0054) from Drs. {cite:t}`Schinske:2014`.

I am not quite ready to fully move away from Traditional Grading yet (mostly because of a lack of resources, otherwise I'm totally all-in!) but I'd like to experiment with a modified version of Specifications-Grading this term.
Here are some [key features](https://twitter.com/siwelwerd/status/1472940473924960261) of Specifications Grading:

- Each assignment is accompanied with a clear list of "specifications" of what constitutes acceptable work at each level.
- Assignments are marked based on whether students have met each of the specifications for that assignment.
- Students are given opportunities to revise their work to demonstrate their learning.

For **only the Labs and Class Activity assignments** this term, {numref}`specifications_rubric` shows a handy guide to help you understand this grading system:

This table describes how I think each course activity should be classified between knowledge transfer and sense-making.
```
I prefer **not** to associate percentages or grades to the levels (I personally feel that this hampers your learning and poisons motivation and creativity), but I know that it will take us some time to eliminate grades completely.
If you must think of things in terms of numbers and percentages, you can expand the box below to see my best guess of what each level translates into.

```{admonition} Resist the temptation to click this button!

Some hidden toggle content!

- The **E** level is about 100%.
- The **G** level is about 85%.
- The **R** level is < 50%.
- The **I** level does not have a number associated because it was not graded.
```

#### Resubmission Policy

For **only the Labs and Class Activity assignments** this term, you will be able to resubmit as many times as you like after you receive feedback.
Each time you do a resubmission, you will first need to reflect on your initial submission, and discuss how you corrected your work after receiving feedback from the TAs.

Your resubmission request can be submitted on Ed Discussion.

There is no limit to the number of resubmissions you are allowed to use, but we reserve the right to decline your resubmission if your reflection is not up to our specifications.

```{note}
Note: The last day to submit resubmissions is the last day of the course. No exceptions!
