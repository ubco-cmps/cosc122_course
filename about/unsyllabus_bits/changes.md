In this section, I will outline any changes that have been made to the unsyllabus as we go through the course.
We will do our best to follow the plan outlined in this unsyllabus, but in case things go south, I will need to make adjustments to the contents and the schedule.

Any major changes to the syllabus (this page) will be documented here, as well as the date the change was made. 

| Change Date    | Summary                               | Rationale                                                                                                                                                       |

| March 11, 2022 | Adjusted Content for Weeks 12, 13, 14 | April 10th is the last day of classes and since that's a Monday and our classes are usually on Thursday, that means our class will be in Week 13 of the course. |
